        <h4 class="sectionTitle1"><u>Me</u></h4>
          <p class="sectionText">My name is Daniel Ruben Ybanez , an asprining self-taugh web developer. I'm currently 20 years old and living in a small town called Page in Arizona. We have a power-plant, a dam, horseshoe bend, and the back side of the Grand Canyon. A beautiful place if you are into nature or landscapes. I was born in Phoenix but raised in Page, am half Hispanic and Navajo.I always been into technology and the Internet at a young age , from watching sci-fi movie to getting into code. Most of my peers around Page aren't really into technology beside getting the "new" iPhone or using the trending app. I'm can be anti-social and socially awkward, im not the extreme awkward but more like funny awkward i would say. I also like meeting new people and working with a team , makes the work more fun and brings the best and worst of people and makes you more accountable and forces you to grow. But i can work alone , i been working since i graduated from my High School. Since i'm being self-taught and learning from books and site like MDN docs, Codecademy, Udemy and videos from youtube.</p>
          <p class="sectionText"> I started with a simple html page and slowly moved towards full web api and website. When i first started I felt overwhelmed and lost and frustrated when my code won't worked as i thought. But almost a year has past since i started my journey and i have grow more mature and patient and know what to do when things aren't going as according to plan. I feel less lost and have a good footing in web development , i'm currently working on  <u>MEAN</u> stack. Beside of working of being hired as a full-time web developer , i'm huge into gym life. More exact is Power-lifting for the health benefits and help coup with my anxiety and stress and over-thinking. And movies , i love watching movies from cheesy 80's shoot-them up to movies of the year like War of planet of the apes. Also liked read comics (Marvel heavy) and read some Manga but watch some animes.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h4 class="sectionTitle2"><u>Goals</u></h4>
          <p class="sectionText">By the end of 2017 , i'm planning to make 3 or 4 full functional website for local business in my town. Get more familiar with MEAN stack and different framework such as babel and Sass. And learn a bit more about digital art for pictures for my sites. Most importantly is a company will pick me up and eventually I'll be able to move closer to the company. Then hopefully stay with a company for couple of years , want to get my junior web developer years with the same company. Then move onto a bigger company and start becoming a senior web developer. I want web development to be lifetime career , I love coding and seeing the final product . Seeing all my hard-work to pay-off is an award by it's self. The whole saying of "if you love what you doing, you'll never work a day in your life" is becoming true and true each day for me. </p>
          <p class="sectionText">My goals seems to be naive, which is fine to me. I'm also hoping that I'll be with a company or team that can show me more deeper into this field. I'm alone on my coding journey and need some real guidance how to plan,think,act,be more effectively and realistic. I love being those around those who walk the walk instead of talk the talk. I firmly believe that actions speak louder than words, Let your actions speak for you. This may take some time which is expected to happen, the fools in life want the rewards quick - patience, consistence and effort are their great enemy. I want to being coding til the day i die , i may only got a year down but i want this one year to be transform into decades. </p>
